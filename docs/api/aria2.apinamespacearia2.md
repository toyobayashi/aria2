## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [addMetalink(metalink, options, position)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.addmetalink.md) |  | This method adds a Metalink download by uploading a ".metalink" file. metalink is a base64-encoded string which contains the contents of the ".metalink" file. options is a struct and its members are pairs of option name and value. See Options below for more details. If position is given, it must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at position in the waiting queue. If position is omitted or position is larger than the current size of the queue, the new download is appended to the end of the queue. This method returns an array of GIDs of newly registered downloads. If <code>--rpc-save-upload-metadata</code> is <code>true</code>, the uploaded data is saved as a file named hex string of SHA-1 hash of data plus ".metalink" in the directory specified by <code>--dir</code> option. E.g. a file name might be 0a3893293e27ac0490424c06de4d09242215f0a6.metalink. If a file with the same name already exists, it is overwritten! If the file cannot be saved successfully or <code>--rpc-save-upload-metadata</code> is <code>false</code>, the downloads added by this method are not saved by <code>--save-session</code>. |
|  [addTorrent(torrent, uris, options, position)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.addtorrent.md) |  | This method adds a BitTorrent download by uploading a ".torrent" file. If you want to add a BitTorrent Magnet URI, use the <code>aria2.addUri()</code> method instead. torrent must be a base64-encoded string containing the contents of the ".torrent" file. uris is an array of URIs (string). uris is used for Web-seeding. For single file torrents, the URI can be a complete URI pointing to the resource; if URI ends with /, name in torrent file is added. For multi-file torrents, name and path in torrent are added to form a URI for each file. options is a struct and its members are pairs of option name and value. See Options below for more details. If position is given, it must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at position in the waiting queue. If position is omitted or position is larger than the current size of the queue, the new download is appended to the end of the queue. This method returns the GID of the newly registered download. If <code>--rpc-save-upload-metadata</code> is <code>true</code>, the uploaded data is saved as a file named as the hex string of SHA-1 hash of data plus ".torrent" in the directory specified by <code>--dir</code> option. E.g. a file name might be <code>0a3893293e27ac0490424c06de4d09242215f0a6.torrent</code>. If a file with the same name already exists, it is overwritten! If the file cannot be saved successfully or <code>--rpc-save-upload-metadata</code> is <code>false</code>, the downloads added by this method are not saved by <code>--save-session</code>. |
|  [addUri(uris, options, position)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.adduri.md) |  | This method adds a new download. uris is an array of HTTP/FTP/SFTP/BitTorrent URIs (strings) pointing to the same resource. If you mix URIs pointing to different resources, then the download may fail or be corrupted without aria2 complaining. When adding BitTorrent Magnet URIs, uris must have only one element and it should be BitTorrent Magnet URI. options is a struct and its members are pairs of option name and value. See <code>Options</code> below for more details. If position is given, it must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at position in the waiting queue. If position is omitted or position is larger than the current size of the queue, the new download is appended to the end of the queue. This method returns the GID of the newly registered download. |
|  [changeGlobalOption(options)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.changeglobaloption.md) |  | This method changes global options dynamically. options is a struct. This method returns OK for success. |
|  [changeOption(gid, options)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.changeoption.md) |  | This method changes options of the download denoted by gid (string) dynamically. options is a struct. This method returns OK for success. |
|  [changePosition(gid, pos, how)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.changeposition.md) |  | This method changes the position of the download denoted by gid in the queue. pos is an integer. how is a string. If how is POS\_SET, it moves the download to a position relative to the beginning of the queue. If how is POS\_CUR, it moves the download to a position relative to the current position. If how is POS\_END, it moves the download to a position relative to the end of the queue. If the destination position is less than 0 or beyond the end of the queue, it moves the download to the beginning or the end of the queue respectively. The response is an integer denoting the resulting position. |
|  [changeUri(gid, fileIndex, delUris, addUris, position)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.changeuri.md) |  | This method removes the URIs in delUris from and appends the URIs in addUris to download denoted by gid. delUris and addUris are lists of strings. A download can contain multiple files and URIs are attached to each file. fileIndex is used to select which file to remove/attach given URIs. fileIndex is 1-based. position is used to specify where URIs are inserted in the existing waiting URI list. position is 0-based. When position is omitted, URIs are appended to the back of the list. This method first executes the removal and then the addition. position is the position after URIs are removed, not the position when this method is called. When removing an URI, if the same URIs exist in download, only one of them is removed for each URI in delUris. In other words, if there are three URIs <code>http://example.org/aria2</code> and you want remove them all, you have to specify (at least) 3 <code>http://example.org/aria2</code> in delUris. This method returns a list which contains two integers. The first integer is the number of URIs deleted. The second integer is the number of URIs added. |
|  [forcePause(gid)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.forcepause.md) |  | This method pauses the download denoted by gid. This method behaves just like <code>aria2.pause()</code> except that this method pauses downloads without performing any actions which take time, such as contacting BitTorrent trackers to unregister the download first. |
|  [forcePauseAll()](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.forcepauseall.md) |  | This method is equal to calling <code>aria2.forcePause()</code> for every active/waiting download. This methods returns <code>OK</code>. |
|  [forceRemove(gid)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.forceremove.md) |  | This method removes the download denoted by gid. This method behaves just like <code>aria2.remove()</code> except that this method removes the download without performing any actions which take time, such as contacting BitTorrent trackers to unregister the download first. |
|  [forceShutdown()](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.forceshutdown.md) |  | This method shuts down <code>aria2()</code>. This method behaves like :func:'aria2.shutdown<!-- -->\` without performing any actions which take time, such as contacting BitTorrent trackers to unregister downloads first. This method returns <code>OK</code>. |

|  [getGlobalOption()](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.getglobaloption.md) |  | This method returns the global options. The response is a struct. Its keys are the names of options. Values are strings. Note that this method does not return options which have no default value and have not been set on the command-line, in configuration files or RPC methods. Because global options are used as a template for the options of newly added downloads, the response contains keys returned by the <code>aria2.getOption()</code> method. |
|  [getGlobalStat()](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.getglobalstat.md) |  | This method returns global statistics such as the overall download and upload speeds |
|  [getOption(gid)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.getoption.md) |  | This method returns options of the download denoted by gid. The response is a struct where keys are the names of options.

|  [tellActive(keys)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.tellactive.md) |  | This method returns a list of active downloads. The response is an array of the same structs as returned by the <code>aria2.tellStatus()</code> method. |
|  [tellStatus(gid, keys)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.tellstatus.md) |  | This method returns the progress of the download denoted by gid (string). keys is an array of strings. If specified, the response contains only keys in the keys array. If keys is empty or omitted, the response contains all keys. This is useful when you just want specific keys and avoid unnecessary transfers. For example, <code>aria2.tellStatus(&quot;2089b05ecca3d829&quot;, [&quot;gid&quot;, &quot;status&quot;])</code> returns the gid and status keys only. The response is a struct. Values are strings. |
|  [tellStopped(offset, num, keys)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.tellstopped.md) |  | This method returns a list of stopped downloads. offset is an integer and specifies the offset from the least recently stopped download. num is an integer and specifies the max. number of downloads to be returned.

For the keys parameter, please refer to the <code>aria2.tellStatus()</code> method. If offset is a positive integer, this method returns downloads in the range of \[offset, offset + num). offset can be a negative integer. offset == -1 points last download in the waiting queue and offset == -2 points the download before the last download, and so on. Downloads in the response are in reversed order then. |
|  [unpause(gid)](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.unpause.md) |  | This method changes the status of the download denoted by gid (string) from <code>paused</code> to <code>waiting</code>, making the download eligible to be restarted. This method returns the GID of the unpaused download. |
|  [unpauseAll()](./aria2.apinamespacearia2.unpauseall.md) |  | This method is equal to calling <code>aria2.unpause()</code> for every paused download. This methods returns <code>OK</code>. |
