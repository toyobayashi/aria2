## FileInfo.completedLength property

Completed length of this file in bytes. Please note that it is possible that sum of `completedLength` is less than the `completedLength` returned by the `aria2.tellStatus()` method. This is because `completedLength` in `aria2.getFiles()` only includes completed pieces. On the other hand, `completedLength` in `aria2.tellStatus()` also includes partially completed pieces.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
completedLength: string;
```
